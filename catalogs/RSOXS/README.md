9f033a6a-79e2-4449-a716-4a9766299b15 | spectral data - interesting thing here is I'm collecting monitors as the primary measurement, which are going really fast, so I go back through and average the monitors for the timestamps between primary steps to get mean and stdev values for nice plotting
e96bf63c-16b3-4415-b3e3-26a5e4ae72fa | different channels have data here, otherwise the same style as above
6fc30d13-f5a3-49e4-a030-b231b203be7c | Usual basic energy scan dataset, interested in both the 1D monitor data(as above) but also the image data at each step.  Being able to select certain images (by clicking on a list of energies that are available) to tile and compare, and then reduce and analyze further is the important user interaction needed, as well as switching to the 1D data view as above (maybe selecting interesting image from the tile and highlighting those values on the ID scan or visa versa).
68d58334-a49a-45f9-a716-a28f6e9625a8 | spiral search dataset, everything as above, but here I want a very easy way to show all of the images (as they are coming in) and allow users to tag the "good" and "bad" ones, and record the relevant positions quickly of the "best position" (here the x and y motor positions) this will be used for machine learning to automatically tag bad ones in the future, and allow automatic spiral searching - this is the most time intensive part of the data collection process for users
777b44ae-4576-4a15-b044-d5fc6e88797b | SAXS and WAXS images simultaneously, sometimes people will want to analyze both, sometimes only one.
f9bca3d9-74e2-4523-9d0d-5294829eb3dc | same as above
745e3f30-3b6a-4ec6-b36d-419cc05a6923 | snapshot, interested in seeing the single image (here it is actually two cameras at once) as quick as possible, for live adjustment
0c7df870-8a9b-4d18-94be-aab606b36b07 | single image snapshot
